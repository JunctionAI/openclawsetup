## Key Features

### 🧠 Perfect Memory
Clawdbot remembers everything you tell it. No need to repeat yourself. It builds up context over time and becomes more useful the more you use it.

### ⚡ Proactive Monitoring
Set up heartbeats (periodic checks) and Clawdbot will:
- Monitor your inbox for urgent messages
- Alert you about upcoming calendar events
- Check on projects and tasks
- Run automated workflows

### 🔗 Self-Service Setup
Connect tools with one click. No manual configuration, no technical setup required.

### 📝 Workspace Files
Your workspace includes editable files:
- `SOUL.md` - Your assistant's personality and behavior
- `USER.md` - Your preferences and context
- `MEMORY.md` - Long-term curated memories
- `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` - Daily logs

Edit these to customize your assistant's behavior!

## Usage Tips

### Best Practices
1. **Be specific**: "Schedule a call with Sarah next Tuesday at 3pm" is better than "schedule call"
