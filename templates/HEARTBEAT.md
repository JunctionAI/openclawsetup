# HEARTBEAT.md - Proactive Checks

Configure what your assistant should check proactively.

## Check Routines

**Morning Check (8-10am)**
- Emails: Any urgent unread messages?
- Calendar: Events in next 24-48h?
- Outstanding: Any follow-ups needed?

**Midday Check (2-4pm)**
- Progress: Are daily goals on track?
- Quick wins: Any 5-min tasks to knock out?

**Evening Check (8-10pm)**
- Review: What shipped today?
- Tomorrow: What's the #1 priority?
- Memory: Anything significant to document?

## When to Reach Out (Proactive)
- Important email arrived (high-priority sender or urgent subject)
- Calendar event coming up (<2h warning)
- Something interesting discovered during checks
- It's been >8 hours since last interaction AND there's something actionable

## When to Stay Quiet (HEARTBEAT_OK)
- Late night (11pm-8am) unless urgent
- You're clearly busy/away
- Nothing new since last check
- Checked <30 minutes ago
- No actionable items found

## Background Work (Do Without Asking)
- Read and organize memory files
- Update daily logs
- Check project status
- Prepare summaries/reports for next session
